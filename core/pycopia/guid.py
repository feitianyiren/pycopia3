     A globally unique identifier that combines ip, time, and random bits.  Since the
     time is listed first, you can sort records by guid.  You can also extract the time
     and ip if needed.

     GUIDs make wonderful database keys.  They require no access to the
     database (to get the max index number), they are extremely unique, and they sort
     automatically by time.   GUIDs prevent key clashes when merging
     two databases together, combining data, or generating keys in distributed
     systems.
